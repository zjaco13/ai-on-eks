# NVIDIA NIM Operator on Amazon EKS

## [What is NVIDIA NIM?](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/introduction.html)

**NVIDIA NIM** ([NVIDIA Inference Microservices](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/introduction.html)) is a set of containerized microservices that make it easier to deploy and host large language models (LLMs) and other AI models in your own environment. NIM provides standard APIs (similar to OpenAI or other AI services) for developers to build applications like chatbots and AI assistants, while leveraging NVIDIA’s GPU acceleration for high-performance inference. In essence, NIM abstracts away the complexities of model runtime and optimization, offering a fast path to inference with optimized backends (e.g., TensorRT-LLM, FasterTransformer, etc.) under the hood.

## [NVIDIA NIM Operator for Kubernetes](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/index.html#)

The **NVIDIA NIM Operator** is a Kubernetes operator that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of NVIDIA NIM microservices on a Kubernetes cluster.

![NVIDIA NIM Operator Architecture](../img/NIMOperatorArchitecture.png)

Instead of manually pulling containers, provisioning GPU nodes, or writing YAML for every model, the NIM Operator introduces three primary [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/crds.html):

- [`NIMCache`](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/cache.html)
- [`NIMService`](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/service.html)
- [`NIMPipeline`] (https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/pipelines.html)

These CRDs allow you to declaratively define model deployments using native Kubernetes syntax.

The Operator handles:
- Pulling the model image from NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)
- Caching model weights and optimized runtime profiles
- Launching model-serving pods with GPU allocation
- Exposing inference endpoints via Kubernetes Services
- Integrating with autoscaling (e.g., HPA + Karpenter)
- Chaining multiple models together into inference pipelines using NIMPipeline

### [NIMCache – Model Caching for Faster Load Times](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/cache.html)

A `NIMCache` (`nimcaches.apps.nvidia.com`) is a custom resource that pre-downloads and stores a model’s weights, tokenizer, and runtime-optimized engine files (such as TensorRT-LLM profiles) into a shared persistent volume.

This ensures:
- **Faster cold start times**: no repeated downloads from NGC
- **Storage reuse across nodes and replicas**
- **Centralized, shared model store** (typically on EFS or FSx for Lustre in EKS)

Model profiles are optimized for specific GPUs (e.g., A10G, L4) and precisions (e.g., FP16). When NIMCache is created, the Operator discovers available model profiles and selects the best one for your cluster.

> 📌 Tip: Using `NIMCache` is highly recommended for production, especially when running multiple replicas or restarting models frequently.

### [NIMService – Deploying and Managing the Model Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/service.html)

A `NIMService` (`nimservices.apps.nvidia.com`) represents a running instance of a NIM model server on your cluster. It specifies the container image, GPU resources, number of replicas, and optionally the name of a `NIMCache`.

Key benefits:
- **Declarative model deployment** using Kubernetes YAML
- **Automatic node scheduling** for GPU nodes
- **Shared cache support** using `NIMCache`
- **Autoscaling** via HPA or external triggers
- **ClusterIP or Ingress support** to expose APIs

For example, deploying the Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model involves creating:
- A `NIMCache` to store the model (optional but recommended)
- A `NIMService` pointing to the cached model and allocating GPUs

If `NIMCache` is not used, the model will be downloaded each time a pod starts, which may increase startup latency.

### [NIMPipeline](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/pipeline.html)

`NIMPipeline` is another CRD that can group multiple `NIMService` resources into an ordered inference pipeline. This is useful for multi-model workflows like:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings + LLM chaining
- Preprocessing + classification pipelines

> In this tutorial, we focus on a single model deployment using `NIMCache` and `NIMService`.

## Overview of this deployment pattern on Amazon EKS

This deployment blueprint demonstrates how to run the **Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** model on **Amazon EKS** using the **NVIDIA NIM Operator** with multi-GPU support and optimized model caching for fast startup times.

![NVIDIA NIM Operator Architecture](../img/NIMOperatoronEKS.png)

The model is served using:
- **G5 instances (g5.12xlarge)**: These instances come with **4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs**
- **Tensor Parallelism (TP)**: Set to `2`, meaning the model will run in parallel across **2 GPUs**
- **Persistent Shared Cache**: Backed by Amazon **EFS** to speed up model startup by reusing previously generated engine files

By combining these components, the model is deployed as a scalable Kubernetes workload that supports:
- Efficient GPU scheduling with [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/)
- Fast model load using the [`NIMCache`](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/cache.html)
- Scalable serving endpoint via [`NIMService`](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim-operator/latest/service.html)

> 📌 Note: You can modify the `tensorParallelism` setting or select a different instance type (e.g., G6 with L4 GPUs) based on your performance and cost requirements.


:::warning

Note: Before implementing NVIDIA NIM, please be aware it is part of [NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/), which may introduce potential cost and licensing for production use.

### Deploy llama-3.1-8b-instruct with NIM Operator

#### Step 1: Create Secrets for Authentication
To access the NVIDIA container registry and model artifacts, you'll need to provide your NGC API key. This script creates two Kubernetes secrets: `ngc-secret` for Docker image pulls and `ngc-api-secret` for model authorization.

```bash
cd blueprints/inference/gpu/nvidia-nim-operator-llama3-8b

NGC_API_KEY="your-real-ngc-key" ./deploy-nim-auth.sh
```

#### Step 2: Cache the Model to EFS using NIMCache CRD

The `NIMCache` custom resource will pull the model and cache optimized engine profiles to EFS. This dramatically reduces startup time when launching the model later via `NIMService`.

```bash
cd blueprints/inference/gpu/nvidia-nim-operator-llama3-8b

kubectl apply -f nim-cache-llama3-8b-instruct.yaml
```

Check status:

```bash
kubectl get nimcaches.apps.nvidia.com -n nim-service
```

Expected output:

```
NAME                      STATUS   PVC                           AGE
meta-llama3-8b-instruct   Ready    meta-llama3-8b-instruct-pvc   21h
```


Display cached model profiles:

```bash
kubectl get nimcaches.apps.nvidia.com -n nim-service \
  meta-llama3-8b-instruct -o=jsonpath="{.status.profiles}" | jq .
```

Sample output:

```json
[
  {
    "config": {
      "feat_lora": "false",
      "gpu": "A10G",
      "llm_engine": "tensorrt_llm",
      "precision": "fp16",
      "profile": "throughput",
      "tp": "2"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Step 3: Deploy the Model using NIMService CRD

Now launch the model service using the cached engine profiles.

```bash
cd blueprints/inference/gpu/nvidia-nim-operator-llama3-8b

kubectl apply -f nim-service-llama3-8b-instruct.yaml
```

Check the deployed resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n nim-service
```

Exepcted Output:

```

### Test the Model with a Prompt

#### Step 1: Port Forward the Model Service

Expose the model locally using port forwarding:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n nim-service service/meta-llama3-8b-instruct 8001:8000
```

#### Step 2: Send a Sample Prompt Using curl

Run the following command to test the model with a chat prompt:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What should I do for a 4 day vacation at Cape Hatteras National Seashore?"
      }
    ],
    "top_p": 1,
    "n": 1,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "stream": false,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.0,

## Performance Testing with NVIDIA GenAI-Perf Tool

[GenAI-Perf](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/client/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf/README.html) is a command line tool for measuring the throughput and latency of generative AI models as served through an inference server.

GenAI-Perf can be used as standard tool to benchmark with other models deployed with inference server. But this tool requires a GPU. To make it easier, we provide you a pre-configured manifest `genaiperf-deploy.yaml` to run the tool.

```bash
cd ai-on-eks/blueprints/inference/gpu/nvidia-nim-operator-llama3-8b
kubectl apply -f genaiperf-deploy.yaml
```

Once the pod is ready with running status `1/1`, can execute into the pod.

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get po -l app=genai-perf -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash
```

Run the testing to the deployed NIM Llama3 model

```bash
genai-perf profile -m meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --url meta-llama3-8b-instruct.nim-service:8000 \
  --service-kind openai \
  --endpoint-type chat \
  --num-prompts 100 \
  --synthetic-input-tokens-mean 200 \
  --synthetic-input-tokens-stddev 0 \
  --output-tokens-mean 100 \
  --output-tokens-stddev 0 \
  --concurrency 20 \
  --streaming \
  --tokenizer hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer
```

You should see similar output like the following

## Cleanup

To tear down the deployed model and associated infrastructure:

### Step 1: Delete Model Resources

Delete the deployed `NIMService` and `NIMCache` objects from your cluster:

```bash
cd blueprints/inference/gpu/nvidia-nim-operator-llama3-8b

kubectl delete -f nim-service-llama3-8b-instruct.yaml
kubectl delete -f nim-cache-llama3-8b-instruct.yaml
```

**Verify deletion:**

```
kubectl get nimservices.apps.nvidia.com -n nim-service
kubectl get nimcaches.apps.nvidia.com -n nim-service

### Step 2: Destroy AWS Infrastructure

Navigate back to the root Terraform module and run the cleanup script. This will destroy all AWS resources created for this blueprint, including the VPC, EKS cluster, EFS, and node groups:

```bash
cd ai-on-eks/infra/nvidia-nim
./cleanup.sh
```
