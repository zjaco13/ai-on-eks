*(Pronounced: "AI on EKS")*
> 💡 **Optimized Solutions for AI and ML on EKS**

### Build, Scale, and Optimize AI/ML Platforms on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) 🚀

Welcome to **AI on EKS**, your gateway to scaling **AI and ML** workloads on Amazon EKS. Unlock the potential of [AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) with a rich collection of Terraform Blueprints featuring best practices for deploying robust solutions with advanced logging and observability.

Explore practical patterns for running AI/ML workloads on EKS, leveraging the power of the [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) ecosystem for distributed computing. Utilize advanced serving solutions like [NVIDIA Triton Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for efficient and scalable model inference, and [TensorRT-LLM](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) for optimizing deep learning models.

Take advantage of high-performance [NVIDIA GPUs](https://aws.amazon.com/nvidia/) for intensive computational tasks and leverage AWS’s specialized hardware, including [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) for efficient model training and [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) for cost-effective model inference at scale.

> **Note:** AIoEKS is in active development. For upcoming features and enhancements, check out the [issues](https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-eks/issues) section.

## 🏃‍♀️Getting Started
In this repository, you'll find a variety of deployment blueprints for creating AI/ML platforms with Amazon EKS clusters. These examples are just a small selection of the available blueprints - visit the [AIoEKS website](https://awslabs.github.io/ai-on-eks/) for the complete list of options.

## 🏆 Motivation
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a widely adopted system for orchestrating containerized software at scale. As more users migrate their AI and machine learning workloads to Kubernetes, they often face the complexity of managing the Kubernetes ecosystem and selecting the right tools and configurations for their specific needs.

At [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), we understand the challenges users encounter when deploying and scaling AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes. To simplify the process and enable users to quickly conduct proof-of-concepts and build production-ready clusters, we have developed AI on EKS (AIoEKS). AIoEKS offers opinionated open-source blueprints that provide end-to-end logging and observability, making it easier for users to deploy and manage Ray, vLLM, Kubeflow, MLFlow, Jupyter and other AI/ML workloads. With AIoEKS, users can confidently leverage the power of Kubernetes for their AI and machine learning needs without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.

## 🤝 Support & Feedback
